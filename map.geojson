    "description":"This folio from the Ibrahim Sultan Shahnama is from the preface of the manuscript. Many great patrons of the arts would have their likeness recreated within important text to have their glory and deeds enshrined for future readers. Ibrahim Sultan is no exception. The commissioning of a Shahnama was not only called for the greatness of the stories, but to emphasize the monarchs idealized activities such as hunting, feasting, consulting, excersizing justice and warfare (Abdullaeva, Melville. 2008, 42). \n\n The folio here is a chaotic battle scene that can be divided into three sectors. These being, Ibrahim Sultan leading his troops into battle, the large battle scene in the lower half, depicting the two clashing sides on horseback, wielding swords and bows. Lastly the other contingance of troops behind the hillside on the top right of the folio."},

    "description":"Ibrahim Sultan, the grandson of Timur, was an accomplished governor, patron of the arts and calligrapher in Iran during his lifetime. Ibrahim, under his father, governored the area of Farz in Iran, where he was resopnsible for sponsoring many great works, including a Quran and Shahnama. Here we see a likely depiction of Ibrahim Sultan on horseback, wearing purple outfit, his horse dressed in golden armour, as he prepares to lead his troops into battle. It is unknown if this is a depiction of an actual battle in which Ibrahim Sultan took part in. In his lifetime he is known to have taken part in three battles, these being, Azerbaijan (823 AH, 1421 AD), Nakhchivan(824 AH, 1421 AD) and Khuzestan (825 AH, 1422 AD). This folio is likely enspired by one of these battles(Mirza-Abolqasemi 2019, 975). \n\n Although not clearly identified, Ibrahim Sultan is mot likely to be the character centred in the folio. This characters posture, heading towatds the battle while also addressing the other soldiers, exemplifies his combat ability and leadership quality. This image is truly set out to glorify his rule and character."},

    "description":"Stationed behind Ibrahim Sultan in the top left of the image are mounted soldiers, who seem to be listening to the last instructions being placed upon them by Ibrahim Sultan before they enter the fray of battle. These characters all bear black scarves, and some as well have golden helmets as part of their armour. Each soldier, mounting a horse, which are covered in many different colours of armour. We see a horse covered in blue armour in the front row, seemingly looking out to the image's audience. One of the men on horseback, dressed in a light purple costume, listens intently to the words of Ibrahim Sultan. \n\n Ibrahim Sultan was noted for not only being a great patron of the arts but a skilled warrior as well (Mirza-Abolqasemi 2019, 975). This image gives the impression that he was a brave warrior. He is most likely commanding his most skilled warriors into battle, rousing them with a speech."},
